# Food-Delivery-Management-System

This project involves designing and implementing a food delivery management system for a catering company. The system has three types of users: administrator, regular employee, and client. The administrator can manage the menu, create new products, and generate reports. The client can register, search for products, and create orders. The employee is notified of new orders to prepare for delivery. The system stores the date and time of each order and generates a bill for each order.
